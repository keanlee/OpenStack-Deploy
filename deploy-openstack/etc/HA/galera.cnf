# This file contains wsrep-related mysqld options. It should be included
# in the main MySQL configuration file.
#
# Options that need to be customized:
#  - wsrep_provider
#  - wsrep_cluster_address
#  - wsrep_sst_auth
# The rest of defaults should work out of the box.

##
## mysqld options _MANDATORY_ for correct opration of the cluster
##
[mysqld]

# (This must be substituted by wsrep_format)
#Ensure that the binary log format is set to use row-level replication, as opposed to statement-level replication:
binlog_format=ROW

# Currently only InnoDB storage engine is supported
default-storage-engine=innodb

# to avoid issues with 'bulk mode inserts' using autoinc
#Ensure that the InnoDB locking mode for generating auto-increment values is set to 2, which is the interleaved locking mode:
innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2
# Override bind-address
# In some systems bind-address defaults to 127.0.0.1, and with mysqldump SST
# it will have (most likely) disastrous consequences on donor node
bind-address=this-host-ip

## WSREP options

#Ensure that the InnoDB log buffer is written to file once per second, rather than on each commit, to improve performance:
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=0

#Define the InnoDB memory buffer pool size. The default value is 128 MB, but to compensate for 
#Galera Clusterâ€™s additional memory usage, scale your usual value back by 5%:

# Human-readable node name (non-unique). Hostname by default.

# Base replication <address|hostname>[:port] of the node.
# The values supplied will be used as defaults for state transfer receiving,
# listening ports and so on. Default: address of the first network interface.

# Command to call when node status or cluster membership changes.
# Will be passed all or some of the following options:
# --status  - new status of this node
# --uuid    - UUID of the cluster
# --primary - whether the component is primary or not ("yes"/"no")
# --members - comma-separated list of members
# --index   - index of this node in the list

## WSREP State Transfer options
##

# State Snapshot Transfer method
wsrep_sst_method=rsync

# Address which donor should send State Snapshot to.
# Should be the address of THIS node. DON'T SET IT TO DONOR ADDRESS!!!
# (SST method dependent. Defaults to the first IP of the first interface)
#wsrep_sst_receive_address=

# SST authentication string. This will be used to send SST to joining nodes.
# Depends on SST method. For mysqldump method it is root:<root password>
